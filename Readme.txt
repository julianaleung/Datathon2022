Description
In many subsurface engineering applications, water is injected underground. One example is
geothermal energy extraction: cold water is injected at one spot, and hot water is produced from
another. Other examples include oil/gas reservoir development or solution mining processes. The
physical process is generally complex, involving highly nonlinear relationships among different
variables. Here, we simplify the problem by considering only single-phase water in a setting with
very low compressibility flow and constant temperature. A simple way to look at it is that this is
a water injection and production problem in a sandstone reservoir.

The task of this competition is to create a data-driven model to predict the flow rate of 4 specific
producers: 19, 20, 24 and 25 for the 365 days. The inputs are the drilled locationâ€™s static
information and the pressure time series.
